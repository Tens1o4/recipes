        <h2 class="seperator">Description</h2>
        <p class="contents">Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, it is traditionally made in a fire oven but your home oven can do the job.
        The dish is composed of a circular dough, tomato sauce and cheese. These components are the base of the pizza, however
        you can add or change anything you like as long as your pizza has a dough for a bass, a tasty sauce and some kind of
        topping/s.</p>

        <h2 class="seperator">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="contents">
            <li><span class="bold-text">Make the base:</span> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml 
                warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. 
                Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea
                towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it's not essential for a thin crust.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Make the sauce:</span> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
                then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Roll out the dough:</span> if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. 
                On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across,
                using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto
                two floured baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold-text">Top and bake:</span> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in 
                the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, 
                drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. 
                Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. 
                Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
