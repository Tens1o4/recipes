        <h2 class="seperator">Description</h2>
        <p class="contents">Meet my <em>favorite</em> fried egg: the crispy olive oil fried egg. These fried eggs have golden, lacy, crispy edges, which contrast beautifully with their runny yellow yolks. Contrast is everything!</p>
        <h2 class="seperator">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="contents">
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="seperator">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="contents">
            <li>Crack the egg into a bowl first. You can more easily avoid oil splatters this way. I also find that pouring from a bowl yields a more evenly shaped fried egg that cooks a little more evenly.</li>
            <li>Make sure the oil is hot before you pour in the egg. This helps ensure that the egg doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, and yields super crispy edges.</li>
            <li>Be careful and watch out for hot oil splatters! This recipe is going to leave some tiny oil splatters on your stovetop. You'll want to step away after you pour in the egg to avoid getting splattered yourself.</li>
            <li>A note on basting the  egg white with oil: Most olive oil fried egg recipes suggest basting the egg white (not the yolk) with the hot olive oil while it cooks. You can do this by tilting the pan and scooping up some of the hot oil with a spoon. However, I can't do this without burning my hand with oil splatters! My eggs turn out great without basting, so I didn't include this in my recipe.</li>
            <li>If you want more firm yolks: For medium eggs, just cook the egg for 30 to 60 more seconds. If you want more firm yolks than that, you can cover the egg for 30 seconds or longer while it cooks.</li>
            <li>Repeat with additional eggs. You can continue frying eggs in the same skillet. Just add another drizzle of olive oil before each egg. You might need to dial down the heat as time goes on (if you catch the faintest whiff of smoke, it's too hot).</li>
            <li>Season as desired. These fried eggs are basically perfect right out of the skillet, but I love to sprinkle them with a little flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve them with a knife and a fork to cut through their crispy undersides!</li>
